Hi there,

this is my first little script. It might be not much but I hate entering these 4 lines in PowerShell to get my Autopilot-Info and mostly I forget the .csv at the end of the file

This script will do all that automatically, you just have to click Y for one NuGet provided, this is normal for Microsoft Scripts

You can Name the file or leave the name empty, in this case the script will read out the Serial Number of the laptop and name the file like that

The script will either Export the file to D:\{Filename} or C:\Windows\Temp\{Filename}

You can change the path within the script to you free will, but most Laptops only have one drive and then the USB Stick takes D:\

Hope you enjoy the script
